    If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
    I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one


    I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
    Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
    Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
    I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
    If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
    You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
    I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
    If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward"
    Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
    They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
    Rap mags try and use my black ass
    So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
    Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
    Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
    I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
    I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one! 
    hit me!

    etc...
